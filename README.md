# Text Classification Using Naive Bayes
In this project Multinomial Naive Bayes(sklearn's MultinomialNB as well as Multinomial Naive Bayes implemented from scratch) has been used for text classification using python 3.
Dataset available at - http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Twenty+Newsgroups
Given a text document we aim to predict the news group category (out of the the 20 given categories) it belongs to.
(If you want quicker run time you can change the directory from 20_newsgroups to mini_newsgroups which consists of a smaller dataset)
## Features
You can fit the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier over the training data, make predictions and get the score(mean accuracy) for testing data.
Our model works fairly well on comparison with sklearn's MultinomialNB.
